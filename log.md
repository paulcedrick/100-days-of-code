# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I setup the repository for my code and forked the github repository for #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I want to put into the challenge the app the I've been working on for weeks. I'm excited to get started with this challenge which could hopefully help me improve the quality of my code by learning how to write unit test and integration test for the project. I would probably start coding tomorrow. :D
