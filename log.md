# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I setup the repository for my code and forked the github repository for #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I want to put into the challenge the app the I've been working on for weeks. I'm excited to get started with this challenge which could hopefully help me improve the quality of my code by learning how to write unit test and integration test for the project. I would probably start coding tomorrow. :D

**Link to work:** [Note Maker](https://github.com/paulcedrick/NoteMaker)

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I created unit test for two functions I added (getNoteById and update) and deleted some files that should not be in the repository.

**Thoughts:** I'm still puzzled if I'm doing TDD right. Anyways, I'm doing my best in making sure that all the codes are testable. :D
